# API Automation with Postman

This repository contains API automation tests for JSONPlaceholder using Postman and Newman.

## Contents

- `JSONPlaceholder_API_Tests.postman_collection.json` — Postman collection for API tests
- Optional: `README.md` — This file
- Optional: `reports/` — HTML reports generated by Newman

## Tests Included

1. **Get All Posts**
     Method: GET
     Endpoint: /posts
     Assertions:
     Status code is 200
     Response contains a list of posts  
3. **Get Single Post**
     Method: GET
     Endpoint: /posts/{id}
     Assertions:
     Status code is 200
     Response contains post with requested ID
5. **Create a Post**
     Method: POST
     Endpoint: /posts
     Payload: JSON object with title, body, userId
     Assertions:
     Status code is 201
     Response contains the newly created post
7. **Update a Post**
     Method: PUT
     Endpoint: /posts/{id}
     Payload: Updated title, body, userId
     Assertions:
     Status code is 200
     Response reflects updated values
9. **Unconventional Behavior Tests**  
   - PUT to create new ID  
   - POST to update existing ID  
   - GET to simulate DELETE
PUT to create a new ID (/posts/10001)
Normally, the POST method is used to create a new resource. Using PUT to create a resource with a non-existing ID is unconventional and may indicate an unusual API design.

POST to update an existing ID (/posts/101)
The POST method is typically used for creating new resources. Using POST to update an already existing resource is unconventional and not standard practice.

GET to simulate DELETE (/posts/101)
The GET method is meant only for retrieving data and cannot delete resources. Attempting to delete using GET is invalid in standard REST APIs and highlights a misuse of HTTP methods.
